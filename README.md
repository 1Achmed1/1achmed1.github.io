Holobrowse Download Instructions:
    If you have a 64-bit Windows machine, it's best to download and install the 64-bit version of the browser, since it runs        faster and it's less intensive and power consuming.
  If you have a 32-bit Windows machine, it's REQUIRED to download and install the 32-bit version of the browser, since it will not   run otherwise.
    You need Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later and  will need to create a desktop shortcut on your own if you want one, since   the installer doesn't give you the option.
  Holobrowse will also not update itself, so you have to download a new installer everytime a new version that you want comes out.
  If you're wondering what the difference between 32- and 64-bit is, it's that the 64 version is more polished, uses differnent     fonts, and runs smoother. Not to mention it uses
  less battery on laptops. Other than that, it's a larger download and doesn't get updated as much. the 32-bit version will run on   64-bit machines.

    If you use mac, download "Holobrowse Mac Download" as a .zip folder by clicking the arrow next to the download button. If you   don't download it as a .zip, it will not download correctly and you
  will be forced to try to fix it yourself.I do not plan on releasing a 64-bit version for mac in the forseeable future, since      it's a waste of time because all Macs running OSX 10.7 and later are 64-bit, therefore
  it's released using a 64-bit framework anyways.

    Holobrowse 2 Bleeding Edge is the newest, some-what stable build of the application. At them moment, the bleeding edge          functions as a standalone and does not need an installer.
