Holobrowse Download Instructions:

If you have a 64-bit Windows machine, it's best to download and install the 64-bit version of the browser, since it runs    faster and it's less intensive and power consuming.
If you have a 32-bit Windows machine, it's REQUIRED to download and install the 32-bit version of the browser, since it will not  run otherwise.
You need Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later and  will need to create a desktop shortcut on your own if you want one, since   the installer doesn't give you the option.
Holobrowse will also not update itself, so you have to download a new installer everytime a new version that you want comes out.
If you're wondering what the difference between 32- and 64-bit is, it's that the 64 version is more polished, uses differnent     fonts, and runs smoother. Not to mention it uses
less battery on laptops. Other than that, it's a larger download and doesn't get updated as much. the 32-bit version will run on  64-bit machines.

If you use mac, download "Holobrowse Mac Download" as a .zip folder by clicking the arrow next to the download button. If you   don't download it as a .zip, it will not download correctly and you
will be forced to try to fix it yourself.I do not plan on releasing a 64-bit version for mac in the forseeable future, since     it's a waste of time because all Macs running OSX 10.7 and later are 64-bit, therefore
it's released using a 64-bit framework anyways.

Holobrowse 2 Bleeding Edge is the newest, some-what stable build of the application. At the moment, the bleeding edge          functions as a standalone and does not need an installer.

Holobrowse 2 was developed on the .NET Framework 4.5 with Windows 10. We recommend that you use Windows 8 or 10 when using Holobrowse, as the following will not display correctly on Windows 7 and Earlier:
- Labels will appear to be located down and to the right of the intended position
- Buttons will seem small and look weird
- The DengXian font that is used throughout the application isn't installed, you can google and buy the font if you want, though
- Some standard HTML and CSS tags won't appear correctly, including the color tag in CSS
- The File menus have a strange darker gray bar to the left of them
- The about pop-up will have wierd text positioning, making it look worse than it should
